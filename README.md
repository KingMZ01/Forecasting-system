# India AQI Analysis & Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for major Indian cities from **2015 to 2024**, leveraging **data science and AI techniques**. The goal is to explore air pollution trends, understand pollutant contributions, and build predictive models for AQI forecasting.

The workflow integrates **data preprocessing**, **EDA**, **correlation analysis**, **feature engineering**, and sets the foundation for **machine learning and time-series modeling**.

## Key Features (Completed)

* ✅ **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Multi-city dataset combined, datetime parsing, duplicates handled.
* ✅ **Missing Values Analysis**: Checked and cleaned pollutant data for consistency.
* ✅ **Outlier Detection & Handling**: Winsorization applied for extreme pollutant values.
* ✅ **AQI Category Distribution**: Overall and city-wise AQI bucket analysis, class balance explored.
* ✅ **Correlation Analysis (in progress)**: Identifying pollutants with strongest impact on AQI.

## Planned Work (Next Steps)

* **Feature Engineering**: Lag features, temporal features, and integration with weather data.
* **Predictive Modeling**:

  * Regression models for AQI prediction (Random Forest, XGBoost).
  * Classification models for AQI bucket prediction.
  * Time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).
* **Visualization & Dashboarding**: City-level AQI trends, pollutant heatmaps, interactive dashboards (Streamlit/Dash).
